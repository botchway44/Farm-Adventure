Tracks how the actions, objects and messages interact with each other

Inventory commands require an ACTION command to be executed. In that sense, you can INTERACT or INVENTORY items in the
current action

| Action | Action TYPE | Comma Separated Reachable Objects |                  Activated Message                   |  Deactivated Message  |
